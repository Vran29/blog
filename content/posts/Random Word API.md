### I created a simple random word api that will generate a random word upon request.

---

To use this, send a post request to this url:

```shell
http://easapi.pythonanywhere.com/api?api_key=Il3KG8LWRwtJ2bMFWT3bpvlMZS1vitJf8LhT95AIRtLDj6CkHLmQm7nnOorUWaqn7ASABJVtDpOsCAsKpZNtRVo3exppbpL99x5cstbYugMmK0FyUBJNjePULoty7YiX
```

This URL inculdes the api key and no other configuration is needed.

> Please don't spam the api, it's hosted on a free server.
